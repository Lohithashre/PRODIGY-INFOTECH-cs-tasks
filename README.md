# PRODIGY-INFOTECH-cs-tasks

During my internship at Prodigy-Infotech, I undertook various cybersecurity tasks and projects that provided valuable hands-on experience in addressing real-world security challenges. The tasks aimed to enhance my knowledge and skills in network security, threat analysis and mitigation, and enterprise security best practices. I gained a deeper understanding of corporate cybersecurity frameworks, such as NIST and ISO 27001, and worked on live security projects, applying theoretical concepts to practical situations. My technical skills were strengthened through hands-on experience with tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, and Nessus. Additionally, I analyzed and interpreted security incidents, applied mitigation strategies, and improved my teamwork and communication skills by collaborating with cross-functional teams. Key projects included network vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, incident response and analysis, secure system design, and cyber threat monitoring using SIEM systems.
